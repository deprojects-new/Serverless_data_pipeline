# Serverless Data Pipeline - Production Grade Architecture

## Problem Statement

Modern web applications generate massive volumes of log data that require real-time processing to extract actionable business intelligence. Organizations need a serverless data pipeline(event-driven) that can automatically process web logs, transform them into business metrics, and provide insights for decision-making while maintaining data quality and operational reliability.

This project addresses these challenges by implementing a production-grade serverless data pipeline using AWS services that automatically processes web application logs, transforms them through multiple data quality layers, and generates business-ready analytics datasets.

## Architecture Overview

The pipeline implements a **Medallion Architecture** with three distinct data layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw JSON web logs with minimal processing
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, validated, and partitioned Parquet data
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready aggregated metrics and KPIs

The architecture is fully serverless, event-driven, and designed for production scalability with comprehensive monitoring and error handling.

## AWS Services and Their Roles

### Core Services

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
- **Purpose**: Data lake storage across all three layers
- **Configuration**: Versioning enabled, AES256 encryption, lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- **Business Value**: Provides scalable, durable, and cost-effective storage for data at rest

**AWS Lambda**
- **Purpose**: Event trigger that initiates the data pipeline
- **Trigger**: S3 object creation events in the bronze layer
- **Business Value**: Eliminates server management overhead and provides automatic scaling

**AWS Step Functions**
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire ETL workflow
- **States**: Coordinates Glue jobs and crawler execution with error handling
- **Business Value**: Provides visual workflow management and built-in retry logic

**AWS Glue**
- **Purpose**: Serverless ETL processing and data catalog management
- **Components**: 
  - ETL Jobs: Transform data between layers
  - Crawler: Automatically discovers and catalogs data schemas
  - Data Catalog: Centralized metadata repository
- **Business Value**: Eliminates infrastructure management for data processing

**Amazon CloudWatch**
- **Purpose**: Monitoring, logging, and alerting
- **Components**: Logs, metrics, alarms
- **Business Value**: Provides operational visibility and proactive issue detection

### Supporting Services

**AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
- **Purpose**: Security and access control
- **Components**: Roles, policies, and user management
- **Business Value**: Ensures least-privilege access and compliance

## Data Flow and Processing Logic

### 1. Data Ingestion (Bronze Layer)
**Trigger**: S3 object creation in `s3://bucket/bronze/`
**Process**: Lambda function receives S3 event and triggers Step Functions execution
**Data Format**: Raw JSON web logs with fields like event_id, event_ts, session_id, method, path, status, etc.

### 2. Bronze to Silver Transformation
**ETL Script**: `src/glue_scripts/bronze_silver.py`
**Processing Logic**:
- **Schema Validation**: Ensures all expected fields are present
- **Data Type Casting**: Converts string values to appropriate data types (int, long)
- **Data Quality Checks**: Validates HTTP status codes, methods, and performance metrics
- **PII Removal**: Masks or removes sensitive client information
- **Partitioning**: Organizes data by year/month/day for efficient querying
- **Output**: Clean Parquet files in `s3://bucket/silver/`



### 3. Silver to Gold Transformation
**ETL Script**: `src/glue_scripts/silver_gold.py`
**Processing Logic**:
- **Incremental Processing**: Uses Glue Job Bookmarks with smart fallback to timestamp-based filtering
- **Business Aggregations**: Calculates daily metrics and session analytics
- **KPI Generation**: Computes error rates, success rates, and performance indicators
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate records in fallback scenarios
- **Output**: Business-ready metrics in `s3://bucket/gold/`
